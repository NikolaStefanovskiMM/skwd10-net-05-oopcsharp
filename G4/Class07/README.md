# Class 07 - Constructors, Enums, Class Libraries, and Inheritance ðŸ˜œ

## Constructors

A huge role in C# classes plays the constructors. Constructor is a method that is executed when an object is created from a class. Constructors in C# classes are written as methods but they don't have any return value and their name is always the same as the class name. The only thing that we can manipulate in a constructor is the parameters. Constructors in C# classes can have multiple constructors, and depending on how we create a class, we get a different execution of a constructor. This always depends on the parameters

```csharp
public class Person
{
  public string Name {get;set;}
  public string Age {get;set;}
  private long AccountNumber {get;set;}
  // Parametarless constructor ( new Person() )
  public Person(){
    AccountNumber = 34235432452;
  }
  // Constructor with parameters ( new Person("Bob", 34) )
  public Person(string name, int age)
  {
    Name = name;
    Age = age;
    AccountNumber = 25325325221;
  }
  public void Talk(string text){
    Console.WriteLine($"Human {Name} is saying {text}");
  }
}
```

### Constructing object from the constructor with parameters

```csharp
// Using the first constructor
Person George = new Person();
// Using the second constructor
Person bill = new Person("Bill", 25);
bill.Talk();
```

 

## Class-based Inheritance

Inheritance is one of the main concepts of object-oriented programming. It is used to connect and link entities that have some hierarchical relation to one another. It can be used to link business logic as well as reuse and organize code. Class-based inheritance means that the inheriting is abstract and that it is done on a class level. Classes inherit from other classes and when an object is created, it has the properties and methods of all the classes in the chain. C# Classes can inherit only from 1 class at a time.

### Overriding methods

C# classes that inherit from other classes have a pretty cool feature. They can override the methods that are on their parents. As long as their parent classes have a method that is open for overriding, they can override it and change the implementation.

```csharp
public class Human
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
    public virtual void PrintInfo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"This is {Name} and it's of the age of {Age}.");
    }
}
```

We override the method PrintInfo() from Human to do something else

```csharp
public class Programmer : Human
{
    public string[] ProgrammingLanugages { get; set; }
    public void DevelopApp()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"The programmer {Name} is developing an app...");
    }
    public override void PrintInfo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"This is {Name} and these are the programming lanugages they know:");
        foreach (string language in ProgrammingLanugages)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(language);
        }
    }
}
```
