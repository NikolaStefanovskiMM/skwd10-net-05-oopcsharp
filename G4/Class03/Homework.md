# Homework Class 3 📒

## Task 1
Create new console application “FindStatistics”. Input 2 numbers. If the two of them are even, print their sum,
if one of them is odd, print their difference, if the two off them are odd, multiply them. Don't print just the result,
but also the whole operation. Treat zero as even.
Please find example below:

  * Enter integer no.1:
    * 3
  * Enter integer no.1:
    * 2
  * Enter integer no.1:
